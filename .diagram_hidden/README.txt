This folder contains a hidden diagram processing workflow for development/testing purposes only.

To run the workflow:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place a hand-drawn diagram image as 'image_e14ecd.jpg' in this folder (already copied for demo).
4. Run the script:
   python diagram_workflow.py

This script is not used by the main website and is hidden from version control and the main app.
